Cotton candy is used through out the site, mainly on the navigation bar and the footer. 
The midnight green is used for the text which includes the logo. 
Piggy pink, White and Onyx are used as background colours. All colours are used to style the buttons. 

### Fonts
The fonts used are Montserrat and Hind. 
Montserrat is used for the logo and the headers and Hind for the rest of the website. 
Fonts were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). The backup font of sans-serif was used incase the fonts do not load for the user.

### Structure
The Bakery Lane website is structured in a user friendly and easy to learn way. Upon arriving to the website, the user sees a navigation bar with the logo on the left-hand side and the navigation links to the right. The navigation bar and footer is located on all pages created.

The website consists of four pages:
*   The homepage has a hero image with a call-to-action button and two sections for types of cakes and flavours
*   An About Us page with a hero image, information about the bakery 
*   A gallery page with images highlighting the different kinds of cakes the bakery sells

## Deployment
### Project creation
This project was created by using the [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) in github. Gitpod was used to write the code and push the code to repository created in github.

The git commands I used to push the code from gitpod to github were

`git add .` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

`git commit -m “commit message”` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

`git push` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.
