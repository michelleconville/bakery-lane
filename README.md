## Deployment
### Project creation
This project was created by using the [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) in github. Gitpod was used to write the code and push the code to repository created in github.

The git commands I used to push the code from gitpod to github were

`git add .` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

`git commit -m “commit message”` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

`git push` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.
